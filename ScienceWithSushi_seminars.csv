No RSVP required.,Impact of information technologies on livestock production in the rangelands,"The rangelands cover approximately 20% of the World’s land surface and provide 16% of annual food production as meat and milk for local and distant markets. Food production from rangelands represents an important source of nutrition as global human population is projected to exceed 9 billion by 2050. There is pressure to increase production from the pastoralism but this has to be done sustainably to ensure the productive capacity is not eroded in the longer term for short term gains.  Information technology represents a very real opportunity to improve livelihoods, increase food production and secure environmental outcomes in the pastoral lands. ",,Dr Ed Charmley,,,"Group Leader & Principal Research Scientist, Agriculture & Food, CSIRO Townsville",,,"Ed comes from a farming background in the UK and received his Bachelors from Aberdeen University and a PhD from The Grassland Research Institute near Reading. After immigrating to Canada he specialized in forage utilization from both grazed and conserved herbage. His particular interests lay in optimizing forage use in the diet with animal performance and beef quality. For the last 10 years, Ed has worked for CSIRO in northern Australia where he has focused on beef production in extensive  sub-tropical rangelands and savannas.  He is based in Townsville. His current research activities lie in the use of technology to record hard to measure animal and environmental variables in the field and understanding livestock methane emissions from extensive grazing systems. He has published widely in the scientific and farming press and manages a broad portfolio of livestock research within the CSIRO Agriculture and Food business unit.",,,http://www.digitalhomestead.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ed-e1427235314250.jpg,,
