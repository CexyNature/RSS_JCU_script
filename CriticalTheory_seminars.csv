In Expulsions, Sassen (2015) investigates our decaying political economy. She maintains that neoliberalism as a concept is insufficient to explain our current condition. Countering reductionist understandings of globalisation, she points to an emergent new dynamic phase of global capitalism that through finance as an ‘extractive sector’ makes new orderings in the economy. Linking events such as rising income inequality, displacement, dispossession, the growth of prison populations, and the degradation of the environment, with assemblages of specialised knowledges and interests, Sassen shows us where invisible logics of expulsion operate, undisturbed, in the global economy. One of the most fundamental undertakings for any society is to be able to govern itself successfully and ensure its survival. In This Changes Everything, Klein (2014) gets to the heart of the existential threat that climate change poses to all life. What are we to do? Her message has more to do with a transformation of how we understand humanity’s power than the fixes of advanced technical engineering feats. Harvey (2004) details the way capitalism plunders, not only natural resources but also people of their rights. Through mechanisms such as stock promotions, asset stripping, along with other systems of accumulation by dispossession that reduce whole populations to debt, Harvey means that classic liberal free-market assumptions do not tell the whole story. For Harvey ‘accumulation by possession’ i.e. state enabled fraud, predation and violence are all fundamental characteristics of the capitalist system. He argues that Accumulation by dispossession is capitalism’s modus operandi.","Sassen, S. 2015. Expulsions: When complexity produces elementary brutalities. Harvard University Press.
