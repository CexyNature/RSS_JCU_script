TESS seminar,Wednesday,4-5 pm,JCU-Cns: Cairns Institute D3.054. JCU-Tsv: ATSIP theatre 145.030,https://research.jcu.edu.au/tess,"Huther, Jaime: abc@jcu.edu.au",https://research.jcu.edu.au/tess/resources/TESS_logo.png,Video-recordings will be posted to the TESS website the following week https://research.jcu.edu.au/tess/seminars-1,Catchment Modelling in the Wet Tropics: can we meet the load reduction targets?,"The Paddock to Reef Loads Modelling Program estimates average annual loads of key pollutants (sediment, nutrients and pesticides) for each of the 35 basins draining to the Great Barrier Reef. It reports on baseline loads and the change in loads for each subsequent year due to adoption of improved land management practices. This assesses progress towards the Reef Plan water quality targets. Source Catchments is the modelling framework used, and major additions to the base modelling framework were made to enable the interaction of soils, climate and land management to be modelled. Major updates to the Source Catchments models occur on a five yearly cycle to ensure continuous improvement. Monitored catchment loads data is used for model validation and calibration. In this talk we present: 1) the background to the Paddock to Reef program, 2) the methodology for catchment modelling in the Wet Tropics, 3) baseline loads, and load reduction due to improved land management practices, 4) scenario modelling to ask the question – can the Reef water quality targets be met?",,Dr Gillian McGloskey,Louise Hateley,,Department of Natural Resources & Mines,Department of Natural Resources & Mines,,"Gillian has an undergraduate degree from the University of Western Australia (B.Sc.) (Env) (Hons) and a PhD through Charles Darwin University in the Northern Territory. Her PhD focussed on the origins (time and cause) of riparian gully erosion features in a remote, grazed savannah landscape. Following the completion of her PhD, Gillian moved to Queensland to take up a position with the State Government. After a few different jobs, she secured a science position as part of the Paddock to Reef program undertaking catchment modelling, which she has been doing for the past 7.5 years running the Cape York catchment model. Gill is also a wife, mother to two young daughters, a keen recreational fisherlady and bushwalker.","Louise HateleyLouise graduated from James Cook University in Townsville and had won a DNRMgraduate position with the Land and Water Science team where she still is today, having been with the department for just over 13 yrs. Louise spent a year a year in the Philippines as an Australian Youth Ambassador for AusAid working on a water quality project during her studies at JCU. Louise was awarded first class honours with Paul Nelson as her Supervisor, and conducted a sediment tracing study in the Tully catchment whilst working for the department. Catchment modelling has been the main focus of Louise’s work over the last 11 years.",,https://research.jcu.edu.au/tess/seminars-1/tess-speaker-profile-pictures/gillian-mcgloskey/@@images/15c82ec7-c101-47f4-a470-e5910b437627.jpeg,https://research.jcu.edu.au/tess/seminars-1/tess-speaker-profile-pictures/louise-hateley/@@images/d0a03363-117d-4e85-87e3-64c9bbe01e0c.jpeg,
